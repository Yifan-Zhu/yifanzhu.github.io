        Hello, thank you for being here! I'm Yifan Zhu and for now I'm in the third year of studying in <a href="http://iao.nuaa.edu.cn/">Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics（NUAA）</a>,<a href="http://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/">College of Computer Science and Technology</a>.Since I was admitted in NUAA in 2017, I have been sparing no efforts to seek for personal all-round development, in order to have a happier and fulfilled life. After two years' experiences of SRTP and studying in Univeristy of Edinburgh, School of Informatics in the first semester of 2019~2020 as a visiting student,I'm more than interested in machine learning and computer networking，distributed machine learning and edge computing in particular. Therefore, recently I'm trying to learn more about them and getting prepared for the next project. BTW, I'm also fond of reading, photographing and playing badminton:)

<h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>
<h4>SRTP: Detection of Safe Driving Via Crowd Sensing						     (Jan 2018 – Sep 2018)</h4>
Research Assistant, College of Computer Science and Technology<br>
By adopting crowdsourcing and crowd-sensing, we monitor the extreme driving behavior during the process of driving, trying to reduce the probability of traffic accidents.
<ul><li>Awarded funding for research as key C project through the college’s Science Foundation Project
 <li>	Participated in collecting information and studying algorithms.
   <li>	Co-published a paper “DSDCS:Detection of Safe Driving Via Crowd Sensing” in the proceedings of ADMA 2018.
    </ul>
<h4>SRTP: Analysis of Network Quality Data Based on Big Data and AI Technology (Jan 2019 - Sep 2019) </h4>
   Group Leader, College of Computer Science and Technology<br>
  By studying intellectual perception incentive mechanism and adopting USRP, we are able to collect data of network quality and then use the matrix filling recovery algorithm to construct network quality real-time visualization map,so that we could predict network quality and analyze network fault based on AI.
   <ul><li> 
    Awarded funding for research as key C project through the college’s Science Foundation Project.
    <li> Leading research in studying incentives.
